# Schema SDK
SDK for Unum ID credential scheme handling, e.g. definitions and validation.

## AJV
[Ajv](https://ajv.js.org/guide/why-ajv.html) is used for schema validation. Currently defining all schemas at initialization however they still end up being compiled in an on demand fashion. If necessary, we can opt to using the pure on-demand schema compilation [strategy](https://ajv.js.org/guide/managing-schemas.html#pre-adding-all-schemas-vs-adding-on-demand) given we would like to support a large number of credential schemas.

### Custom Formats
Custom ajv [formats](https://ajv.js.org/guide/formats.html#user-defined-formats) are being defined an leveraged to add additional assurances in regard to the credential schema data format in addition to its type. 

## TypeBox
[TypeBox](https://github.com/sinclairzx81/typebox) is used to author schemas. This means the attribute type and potentially its format. It is really just syntactic sugar to author JSON Schemas. Opting to not use TypeBox [TypeCompiler](https://github.com/sinclairzx81/typebox#typecompiler) because it is a little less flexible than ajv.

## Git Hooks
This project uses [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) to manage its git hooks.

### Commit Message
 Husky is configured to enforce [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/%40commitlint/config-conventional)'s [Conventual Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/) commit message format. `config-conventional` follows Angular commit convention [guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines).

A message must start with one of the following "types":

* **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
* **ci**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)
* **docs**: Documentation only changes
* **feat**: A new feature
* **fix**: A bug fix
* **perf**: A code change that improves performance
* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
* **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests

It is highly encouraged to include a "scope", .e.g. "schema".

feat(schema): new addressSchema added

The inspiration for this setup was from [this](https://mokkapps.de/blog/how-to-automatically-generate-a-helpful-changelog-from-your-git-commit-messages/) blog post in regard creating and maintaining an automated changelog.

## Release
Releases are automated via Github Actions CI job. In order to trigger a release one should push a git tag with a preceding `v` with semver notation, ie `v1.1.1`, to the `main` branch. This will trigger the CI job to bump the package version, update changelog.md, make a release commit, and make a Github Release. The contents of the Github Release are autogenerated based on pull requests with commits associated with the release, so please use PRs to makes changes to `main`.

### Changelog
The [Standard Version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version) node module is used to automatically populate [changelog.md](/CHANGELOG.md). It should only ever be trigger the but the Publish Github Actions [job](.github/workflows/publish.yaml). Please do **not** use manually.

The Publish job uses the `npm version`-like [option](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version#release-as-a-target-type-imperatively-npm-version-like) to side step its auto version increment logic. Also, `package.json` has [options](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version#skipping-lifecycle-steps) set to disable the tagging and commit functionality. which is being handled independently by Github Actions.
